<h1>THE STUTTERER</h1>

<h2>BY R. R. MERLISS</h2>

<p class="tease">
<i><big>A man</big> can be killed by a toy gun&mdash;he
can die of fright, for heart attacks can
kill. What, then, is the deadly thing that
must be sealed away, forever locked in
buried concrete&mdash;a thing or an idea?</i>
</p>

<p class="illo">Illustrated by Riley</p>







<p>Out of the twenty only one managed
to escape the planet. And he
did it very simply, merely by walking
up to the crowded ticket window
at one of the rocket ports and buying
passage to Earth. His Army
identification papers passed the
harassed inspection of the agent, and
he gratefully and silently pocketed
the small plastic stub that was
handed him in exchange for his
money.</p>

<p>He picked his way with infinite
care through the hordes of ex-soldiers
clamoring for passage back to
the multitudinous planets from
which they had come. Then he slowly
climbed the heavy ramp into the
waiting rocket.</p>

<p>He saw with relief that the seats
were strongly constructed, built to
survive the pressure of many gravities
and he chose one as far removed
as possible from the other
passengers.</p>

<p>He was still very apprehensive,
and, as he waited for the rocket
to take off, he tried hard to remember
the principles of the pulse drive
that powered the ship, and whether
his additional weight would upset
its efficiency enough to awaken suspicion.</p>

<p>The seats filled quickly with excited
hurrying passengers. Soon he
heard the great door clang shut, and
saw the red light flicker on, warning
of the take-off. He felt a slow
surge of pressure as the ship arose
from the ground, and his chair
creaked ominously with the extra
weight. He became fearful that it
might collapse, and he strained forward
trying to shift some of the
pressure through his feet to the floor.
He sat that way, tense and immobile,
for what seemed a long time
until abruptly the strain was relieved
and he heard the rising and falling
whine of the rockets that told him
the ship was in pulse drive, flickering
back and forth across the speed
of light.</p>

<p>He realized that the pilots had not
discovered his extra weight, and that
the initial hazards were over. The
important thing was to look like a
passenger, a returning soldier like
the others, so that no one would
notice him and remember his presence.</p>

<p>His fellow travelers were by this
time chatting with one another, some
playing cards, and others watching
the teledepth screens. These were the
adventurers who had flocked from
all corners of the galaxy to fight in
the first national war in centuries.
They were the uncivilized few who
had read about battle and armed
struggle in their history books and
found the old stories exciting.</p>

<p>They paid no attention to their
silent companion who sat quietly
looking through the quartz windows
at the diamond-bright stars, tacked
against the blackness of infinity.</p>

<p>The fugitive scarcely moved the
entire time of the passage. Finally
when Earth hung out in the sky like
a blue balloon, the ship cut its pulsations
and swung around for a tail
landing.</p>

<p>The atmosphere screamed through
the fins of the rocket, and the continents
and the countries, and then
the rivers and the mountains took
shape. The big ship settled down
as gently as a snowflake, shuddered
a few times and was quiet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The passengers hurriedly gathered
up their scattered belongings and
pushed toward the exit in a great
rush to be out and back on Earth.</p>

<p>The fugitive was the last to leave.
He stayed well away from the others,
being fearful that, if he should
touch or brush up against someone,
his identity might be recognized.</p>

<p>When he saw the ramp running
from the ship to the ground, he was
dismayed. It seemed a flimsy structure,
supported only by tubular steel.
Five people were walking down it,
and he made a mental calculation
of their weight&mdash;about eight hundred
pounds he thought. He weighed
five times that. The ramp was obviously
never built to support such
a load.</p>

<p>He hesitated, and then he realized
that he had caught the eye of the
stewardess waiting on the ground.
A little panicky, he stepped out with
one foot and he was horrified to
feel the steel buckle. He drew back
hastily and threw a quick glance
at the stewardess. Fortunately at the
moment she was looking down one
field and waving at someone.</p>

<p>The ramp floor was supported by
steel tubes at its edges and in its
exact center. He tentatively put one
foot in the middle over the support
and gradually shifted his weight to
it. The metal complained creakily,
but held, and he slowly trod the
exact center line to Earth. The stewardess'
back was turned toward him
as he walked off across the field
toward the customhouse.</p>

<p>He found it comforting to have
under his feet what felt like at least
one yard of cement. He could step
briskly and not be fearful of betraying
himself.</p>

<p>There was one further danger:
the customs inspector.</p>

<p>He took his place at the end of
the line and waited patiently until
it led him up to a desk at which a
uniformed man sat, busily checking
and stamping declarations and traveling
papers. The official, however,
did not even look up when he
handed him his passport and identification.</p>

<p>"Human. You don't have to go
through immigration," the agent
said. "Do you have anything to declare?"</p>

<p>"N-no," the traveler said. "I d-didn't
bring anything in."</p>

<p>"Sign the affidavit," the agent
said and pushed a sheet of paper toward
him.</p>

<p>The traveler picked up a pen
from the desk and signed "Jon Hall"
in a clear, perfect script.</p>

<p>The agent gave it a passing glance
and tossed it into a wire basket.</p>

<p>Then he pushed his uniform cap
back exposing a bald head. "You're
my last customer for a while, until
the rocket from Sirius comes in.
Guess I might as well relax for a
minute." He reached into a drawer
of the desk and pulled out a package
of cigarettes, of which he lit one.</p>

<p>"You been in the war, too?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Hall nodded. He did not want to
talk any more than he had to.</p>

<p>The agent studied his face.</p>

<p>"That's funny," he said after a
minute. "I never would have picked
you for one of these so-called adventurers.
You're too quiet and peaceful
looking. I would have put you
down as a doctor or maybe a writer."</p>

<p>"N-no," Hall said. "I w-was in
the war."</p>

<p>"Well, that shows you can't tell
by looking at a fellow," the agent
said philosophically. He handed Hall
his papers. "There you are. The left
door leads out to the copter field.
Good luck on Earth!"</p>

<p>Hall pocketed the stamped documents.
"Thanks," he said. "I'm glad
to be here."</p>

<p>He walked down the wide station
room to a far exit and pushed the
door open. A few steps farther and
he was standing on a cement path
dug into a hillside.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Across the valley, bright in the
noon sun lay the pine covered slopes
of the Argus mountains, and at his
feet the green Mojave flowering with
orchards stretched far to the north
and south. Between the trees, in the
center of the valley, the Sacramento
River rolled southward in a man-made
bed of concrete and steel giving
water and life to what had a
century before been dry dead earth.</p>

<p>There was a small outcropping
of limestone near the cement walk,
and he stepped over to it and sat
down. He would have been happy
to rest and enjoy for a few moments
his escape and his triumph,
but he had to let the others know
so that they might have hope.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and groped
across the stars toward Grismet.
Almost immediately he felt an impatient
tug at his mind, strong because
there were many clamoring at once
to be heard. He counted them. There
were seventeen. So one more had
been captured since he had left
Grismet.</p>

<p>"Be quiet," the told them. "I'll
let you see, after a while. First I
have to reach the two of us that are
still free."</p>

<p>Obediently, the seventeen were
still, and he groped some more and
found another of his kind deep in
an ice cave in the polar regions of
Grismet.</p>

<p>"How goes it?" he asked.</p>

<p>The figure on Grismet lay stretched
out at full length on the blue ice,
his eyes closed. He answered without
moving: "They discovered my
radiation about an hour ago. Pretty
soon, they'll start blasting through
the ice."</p>

<p>The one on Earth felt the chill
despair of his comrade and let go.
He groped about again until he
found the last one, the only other
one left. He was squatting in the
cellar of a warehouse in the main
city of Grismet.</p>

<p>"Have they picked up your trail
yet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered the one in the
cellar. "They won't for a while. I've
scattered depots of radiation all
through the town. They'll be some
time tracking them all down, before
they can get to me."</p>

<p>In a flash of his mind, Hall revealed
his escape and the one on
Grismet nodded and said: "Be careful.
Be very careful. You are our
only hope."</p>

<p>Hall returned then to the seventeen,
and he said with his thoughts:
"All right, now you can look." Immobile
in their darkness, they
snatched at his mind, and as he
opened his eyes, they, too, saw the
splendors of the mountains and the
valley, the blue sky, and the gold
sun high overhead.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The new man was young, only
twenty-six. He was lean and dark
and very enthusiastic about his work.
He sat straight in his chair waiting
attentively while his superior across
the desk leafed through a folder.</p>

<p>"Jordan. Tom Jordan," the older
man finally said. "A nice old Earth
name. I suppose your folks came
from there."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the new man said
briskly.</p>

<p>The chief closed the folder.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "your first job
is a pretty important one."</p>

<p>"I realize that, sir," Jordan said.
"I know it's a great responsibility
for a man just starting with the
Commission, but I'll give it every
thing I have."</p>

<p>The chief leaned back in his seat
and scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Normally we start a beginner
like you working in a pair with an
older man. But we just haven't got
enough men to go around. There
are eight thousand planets there"&mdash;he
pointed with his thumb over his
shoulder to a wall-sized map of the
galaxy&mdash;"and we've got to cover
every one. It seems reasonable that
if he escaped this planet, he'll go to
another that will by its atmosphere
or its temperature give him some
natural advantage over us&mdash;some
place that is either burning hot or
at absolute zero, or perhaps with a
chlorine or sulfur dioxide atmosphere.
That's why"&mdash;he hesitated a
minute, but continued because he
was a truthful man&mdash;"I picked you
for Earth. It's the most populated
of all the planets and it seems the
least likely one that he would
choose."</p>

<p>Jordan's face dropped a little bit
when he heard the last piece of
information, but he said: "I understand,
sir, and if he's there, I'll bring
him back."</p>

<p>The chief slouched farther back
in his seat. He picked up a shard of
rubidium that served as a paper
weight and toyed with it.</p>

<p>"I guess you know most of the
facts. They are made out of permallium.
Have you ever seen any of the
stuff?"</p>

<p>The new man shook his head. "I
read about it though&mdash;some new
alloy, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Plenty new. It's the hardest stuff
anybody has ever made. If you set
off one hundred successive atom
blasts over a lump of permallium,
you might crystallize and scale maybe
a micron off the surface. It will
stand any temperature or pressure
we can produce. That just means
there's no way to destroy it."</p>

<p>Jordan nodded. He felt a little
honored that the chief was giving
him this explanation in person
rather than just turning him over
to one of the scientific personnel for
a briefing. He did not understand
that the old man was troubled and
was talking the situation through as
much for his own sake as for anyone
else's.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"That's the problem," the chief
continued. "Essentially an indestructible
machine with a built-in source
of power that one can't reach. It had
to be built that way&mdash;a war instrument,
you know."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked squarely
at the bright young man sitting
across the desk. "This lousy war.
You'd think the human race would
grow up some time, wouldn't you?"
He filled a pipe with imported Earth
tobacco and lit it, and took a few
deep puffs. "There's something else.
I don't know how they do it, but
they can communicate with one another
over long distances. That made
them very useful for military purposes.</p>

<p>"They are loyal to one another,
too. They try to protect each other
and keep one another from being
captured. Do you find that surprising?"</p>

<p>The question caught Jordan unprepared.
"Well, yes. It is, kind
of&mdash;" he said. "They are only machines."</p>

<p>The chief closed his eyes for a
moment. He seemed tired.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, "they are only
machines. Anyway, we don't know
everything about them, even yet.
There are still a few secret angles,
I think. The men who could tell us
are either dead or in hiding.</p>

<p>"There's one fact though that
gives us a great advantage. Their
brain"&mdash;he stopped on the word and
considered it&mdash;"I mean their thinking
apparatus gives off a very penetrating
short-wave length radiation
which you can pick up on your
meters anywhere in a radius of two
thousand miles, and you can locate
the source accurately if you get
within fifty miles.</p>

<p>"The only real problem you'll
have in finding them is the confusion
created by illegal atomic piles.
You'd be surprised how many of
them we have turned up recently.
They are owned by private parties
and are run illegally to keep from
paying the tax on sources of power.
You have to track those down, but
once you get them labeled it will be
clear sailing."</p>

<p>He stopped to take a few puffs
on his pipe.</p>

<p>"Don't try to be a hero," he said
after a few moments. "Don't get
close to the thing you are hunting.
None of them yet has injured any
of us, but if one should want to, he
could crush you to death with two
fingers. Use the permallium nets and
net bombs if you locate him."</p>

<p>He tamped his pipe out. "Well,
that's it," he said.</p>

<p>The new man arose. "I want you
to know that I appreciate the trust
you have put in me."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," the chief said, but
it was not unfriendly. "Do you like
the job?"</p>

<p>"It is a great opportunity," Jordan
said, and he meant it.</p>

<p>"What do you think about what
we do to them after we capture
them?"</p>

<p>The new man shrugged. "I suppose
it's the only thing to do. It's not
as though they were human."</p>

<p>"Yeah," the chief said. "I guess
so. Anyway, good luck."</p>

<p>Jordan arose and shook the chief's
hand. However, just as he was stepping
through the door, his superior
asked him another question. "Did
you know that one of them stutters?"</p>

<p>He turned back, puzzled. "Stutters?
Why should he stutter? How
could that be?"</p>

<p>The chief shook his head and
started cleaning out his pipe.</p>

<p>"I don't know for sure. You'd
better get started." He sat back in
his seat and watched the back of
the new man as he disappeared
through the doorway.</p>

<p>That young fellow has a lot to
learn, he thought to himself. But
even so, maybe he's better off than
I am. Maybe I've had too much experience.
Maybe too much experience
puts you back where you started
from. You've done the wrong thing
so many times and profited so many
times from your mistakes that you
see errors and tragedies in everything.</p>

<p>He was depressed, and he did
something that usually made him
feel better again. He reached under
the edge of his desk and pulled a
little switch that made the galactic
map on the wall light up in three-dimensional
depth, then he swung
around in his chair so he could see
it. Eight thousand planets that his
race had conquered, eight thousand
planets hundreds of light-years apart.
Looking at the map gave him a sense
of accomplishment and pride in
humanity which even a stupid war
and its aftermath could not completely
destroy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jon Hall, the fugitive, walked
along the highway leading south
from the rocket port. There was very
little traffic, only an occasional delivery
truck carrying meat or groceries.
The real highway was half a
mile overhead where the copters
shuttled back and forth up and
down the state in neat orderly layers.</p>

<p>The seventeen were inside his
head, looking through his eyes, and
feasting on the blueness of the sky,
and the rich green vegetation that
covered the fertile fields. From time
to time they talked to him, giving
advice, asking questions, or making
comments, but mostly they looked,
each knowing that the hours of their
sight might be very few.</p>

<p>After walking a while, Hall became
aware of someone's footsteps
behind him. He stopped suddenly
in apprehension and swung around.
A dozen or so paces away was a red-headed
boy of about ten or eleven,
dressed in plastic overalls, and carrying
a basket of ripe raspberries. The
stains about his mouth showed that
not all the raspberries were carried
in the basket.</p>

<p>Hall's anxiety faded, and he was
glad to see the child. He had hoped
to meet someone who was not so old
that they would become suspicious,
but old enough that they might give
him directions.</p>

<p>He waited for the lad to catch
up.</p>

<p>"Hello," the boy said. "I've been
walking behind you most of a mile,
but I guess you didn't hear me."</p>

<p>"It looks as though you've been
p-p-picking raspberries," Hall said.</p>

<p>"Yup. My dad owns a patch by
the river. Want some?" He proffered
the basket.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Hall answered.
He resumed his walk up the highway
with the boy at his side.</p>

<p>"D-do you live around here," he
asked.</p>

<p>"Just up the road a ways." The
lad studied his companion for a
minute. "You stutter, don't you?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"There was a boy in my class who
used to stutter. The teacher said it
was because he thought so far ahead
of what he said he got all tangled
up." The boy reached in his basket
for a handful of berries and chewed
them thoughtfully. "She was always
after him to talk slower, but I guess
it didn't do any good. He still stutters."</p>

<p>"Is there a p-power plant around
here?" Hall asked. "You know,
where the electricity comes from."</p>

<p>"You mean the place where they
have the nu-nuclear fission"&mdash;the
boy stumbled on the unfamiliar
word, but got it out&mdash;"and they
don't let you in because you get
poisoned or something?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that's it."</p>

<p>"There are two places. There's
one over at Red Mountain and another
over at Ballarat."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" The boy stopped to
think. "Red Mountain's straight
ahead, maybe ten miles, and Ballarat's
over there"&mdash;he pointed west
across the orange groves&mdash;"maybe
fifteen miles."</p>

<p>"Good," Hall said. "Good." And
he felt glad inside of himself. Maybe
it could be done, he thought.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They walked along together. Hall
sometimes listening to the chattering
of the boy beside him, sometimes
listening to and answering the distant
voices of the seventeen. Abruptly,
a few hundred yards before the
house that the boy had pointed out
as his father's, a small sports car
whipped down the highway, coming
on them almost without warning.
The lad jumped sideways, and Hall,
to avoid touching him, stepped off
the concrete road. His leg sank into
the earth up to the mid-calf. He
pulled it out as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>The boy was looking at the fast
retreating rear of the sports car.</p>

<p>"Gee," he said. "I sure didn't see
them coming." Then he caught sight
of the deep hole alongside the road,
and he stared at it. "Gosh, you sure
made a footprint there," he said
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"The ground was soft," Hall
said. "C-come along."</p>

<p>But instead of following, the boy
walked over to the edge of the road
and stared into the hole. He tentatively
stamped on the earth around
it. "This ground isn't soft," he said.
"It's hard as a rock." He turned and
looked at Hall with big eyes.</p>

<p>Hall came close to the boy and
took hold of his jacket. "D-don't
pay any attention to it, son. I just
stepped into a soft spot."</p>

<p>The boy tried to pull away. "I
know who you are," he said. "I
heard about you on the teledepth."</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the way of children,
panic engulfed him and he flung
his basket away and threw himself
back and forth, trying to tear free.
"Let me go," he screamed. "Let me
go. Let me go."</p>

<p>"Just l-listen to me, son," Hall
pleaded. "Just listen to me. I won't
hurt you."</p>

<p>But the boy was beyond reasoning.
Terror stricken, he screamed at
the top of his voice, using all his
little strength to escape.</p>

<p>"If you p-promise to l-listen to
me, I'll let you go," Hall said.</p>

<p>"I promise," the boy sobbed, still
struggling.</p>

<p>But the moment Hall let go of
his coat, he tore away and ran as
fast as he could over the adjacent
field.</p>

<p>"W-wait&mdash;don't run away," Hall
shouted. "I won't hurt you. Stay
where you are. I couldn't follow you
anyway. I'd sink to my hips."</p>

<p>The logic of the last sentence
appealed to the frightened lad. He
hesitated and then stopped and
turned around, a hundred feet or so
from the highway.</p>

<p>"L-listen," said Hall earnestly.
"The teledepths are wr-wrong. They
d-didn't tell you the t-truth about
us. I d-don't want to hurt anyone.
All I n-need is a few hours. D-don't
tell anyone for j-just a few hours and
it'll be all right." He paused because
he didn't know what to say next.</p>

<p>The boy, now that he seemed
secure from danger had recovered
his wits. He plucked a blade of grass
from the ground and chewed on an
end of it, looking for all the world
like a grownup farmer thoughtfully
considering his fields. "Well, I guess
you could have hurt me plenty, but
you didn't," he said. "That's something."</p>

<p>"Just a few hours," Hall said. "It
won't take long. Y-you can tell your
father tonight."</p>

<p>The boy suddenly remembered his
raspberries when he saw his basket
and its spilled contents on the highway.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go along a bit,"
he said. "I would like to pick up
those berries I dropped."</p>

<p>"Remember," Hall said, "just a
few hours." He turned and started
walking again toward Red Mountain.
Inside his mind, the seventeen asked
anxiously, "Do you think he'll give
the alarm? Will he report your presence?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/002.png" width="700" height="446" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Back on the highway, the boy was
gathering the berries back into his
basket while he tried to make his
mind up.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jordan reached Earth atmosphere
about two o'clock in the afternoon.
He immediately reported in to the
Terrestrial police force, and via the
teledepth screen spoke with a bored
lieutenant. The lieutenant, after
listening to Jordan's account of his
mission, assured him without any
particular enthusiasm of the willingness
of the Terrestrial forces to co&ouml;perate,
and of more value, gave him
the location of all licensed sources
of radiation in the western hemisphere.</p>

<p>The galactic agent set eagerly to
work, and in the next several hours
uncovered two unlisted radiation
sources, both of which he promptly
investigated. In one case, north of
Eugene, he found in the backyard of
a metal die company a small atomic
pile. The owner was using it as an
illegal generator of electricity, and
when he saw Jordan snooping about
with his detection instruments, he
immediately offered the agent a
sizable bribe. It was a grave mistake
since Jordan filed charges against
him, via teledepth, not only for
evading taxes, but also for attempted
bribery.</p>

<p>The second strike seemed more
hopeful. He picked up strong radiation
in a rather barren area of
Montana; however when he landed,
he found that it was arising from the
earth itself. From a short conversation
with the local authorities, he
learned that the phenomenon was
well known: an atomic fission plant
had been destroyed at that site during
the Third World War.</p>

<p>He was flying over the lovely blue
water of Lake Bonneville, when his
teledepth screen flickered. He flipped
the switch on and the lieutenant's
picture flooded in.</p>

<p>"I have a call I think you ought
to take," the Earth official said. "It
seems as though it might be in your
line. It's from a sheriff in a small
town in California. I'll have the
operator plug him in."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Abruptly the picture switched to
that of a stout red-faced man wearing
the brown uniform of a county
peace officer.</p>

<p>"You're the galactic man?" the
sheriff asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. My name is Tom Jordan,"
Jordan said.</p>

<p>"Mine's Berkhammer." It must
have been warm in California because
the sheriff pulled out a large
handkerchief and mopped his brow.
When he was done with that he blew
his nose loudly. "Hay fever," he
announced.</p>

<p>"Want to see my credentials?"</p>

<p>"Oh sure, sure," the sheriff hastily
replied. He scrutinized the card and
badge that Jordan displayed. After
a moment, he said, "I don't know
why I'm looking at those. They
might be fakes for all I know. Never
saw them before and I'll probably
never see them again."</p>

<p>"They're genuine."</p>

<p>"The deuce with formality," the
sheriff said heavily. "There's some
kid around here who thinks he saw
that ... that machine you're supposed
to be looking for."</p>

<p>"When was that?" Jordan asked.</p>

<p>"About four hours ago. Here, I'll
let you talk to him yourself." He
pulled his big bulk to one side, and
a boy and his father walked into the
picture. The boy was red-eyed, as
though he had been crying. The
father was a tall, stoop-shouldered
farmer, dressed like his son in
plastic overalls.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The sheriff patted the boy on the
back. "Come on, Jimmy. Tell the
man what you saw."</p>

<p>"I saw him," the boy said sullenly.
"I walked up the highway with
him."</p>

<p>Jordan leaned forward toward the
screen.</p>

<p>"How did you know who he
was?"</p>

<p>"I knew because when he stepped
on the ground, he sank into it up
to his knee. He tried to say the
ground was soft, but it was hard. I
know it was hard."</p>

<p>"Why did you wait so long to
tell anybody?" Jordan asked softly.</p>

<p>The boy looked at him with defiance
and dislike in his eyes and kept
his small mouth clamped shut.</p>

<p>His father nudged him roughly
in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Answer the man," he commanded.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked down at his shoes.</p>

<p>"Because he asked me not to tell
for a while," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Stubborn as nails," the father
said not without pride in his voice.
"Got more loyalty to a lousy machine
than to the whole human race."</p>

<p>"Which way did he go, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Toward Red Mountain. I think
maybe to the power house. He asked
me where it was."</p>

<p>"What do you think he wants
with that?" the sheriff asked of
Jordan.</p>

<p>Jordan shrugged and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's all in the kid's head,"
the sheriff suggested. "These wild
teledepth programs they look at give
them all kinds of ideas."</p>

<p>"It isn't in my head," Jimmy said
violently. "I saw him. He stepped
on the ground and stuck his foot
into it. I talked to him. And I know
something else. He stutters."</p>

<p>"What?" said the sheriff. "Now
I know you're lying."</p>

<p>The father started dragging the
boy by the arm. "Come on home,
Jimmy. You got one more licking
coming."</p>

<p>Jordan, however, was sure the boy
was not lying. "Leave him alone,"
he said. "He's right. He did see
him." He took a fast look at the
timepiece on his panel board. "I'll
be down in an hour and a half.
Wait for me."</p>

<p>He flicked the switch off, and
kicked up the motors. The ship shot
southward almost as rapidly as a
projectile.</p>

<p>He had topped the Sierras and had
just turned into the great central
valley of California when, with the
impact of a blow, a frightening
thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>He flicked the screen on again,
and he caught the sheriff sitting
behind his desk industriously scratching
himself in one armpit.</p>

<p>"Listen," Jordan said, speaking
very fast. "You've got to send out
a national alarm. You must get every
man you can down to the power
plant. You've got to stop him from
getting in."</p>

<p>The sheriff stopped scratching
himself and stared at Jordan.</p>

<p>"What are you so het up about,
young man?"</p>

<p>"Do it, and do it now," Jordan
almost shouted. "He'll tear the pile
apart and let the hafnium go off.
It'll blow half the state off the
planet."</p>

<p>The sheriff was unperturbed. "Mr.
Star boy," he said sarcastically, "any
grammar school kid knows that if
someone came within a hundred
yards of one of those power-house
piles, he'd burn like a match stick.
And besides why would he want to
blow himself to pieces?"</p>

<p>"He's made out of permallium."
Jordan was shouting now.</p>

<p>The sheriff suddenly grew pale.
"Get off my screen. I'm calling
Sacramento."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jordan set the ship for maximum
speed, well beyond the safety limit.
He kept peering ahead into the
dusk, momentarily fearful that the
whole countryside would light up in
one brilliant flash. In a few minutes
he was sweating and trembling with
the tension.</p>

<p>Over Walnut Grove, he recognized
the series of dams, reservoirs
and water-lifts where the Sacramento
was raised up out of its bed and
turned south. For greater speed, he
came close to Earth, flying at emergency
height, reserved ordinarily for
police, firemen, doctors and ambulances.
He set his course by sight
following the silver road of the river,
losing it for ten or fifteen miles at
a time where it passed through subterranean
tunnels, picking it up again
at the surface, always shooting south
as fast as the atmosphere permitted.</p>

<p>At seven thirty, when the sun had
finally set, he sighted the lights of
Red Mountain, and he cut his speed
and swung in to land. There was no
trouble picking out the power plant;
it was a big dome-shaped building
surrounded by a high wall. It was
so brilliantly lit up, that it stood out
like a beacon, and there were several
hundred men milling about before
it.</p>

<p>He settled down on the lawn inside
the walls, and the sheriff came
bustling up, a little more red in the
face than usual.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to figure for the
last hour what the devil I would do
to stop him if he decided to come
here," Berkhammer said.</p>

<p>"He's not here then?"</p>

<p>The sheriff shook his head. "Not
a sign of him. We've gone over the
place three times."</p>

<p>Jordan settled back in relief, sitting
down in the open doorway of
his ship. "Good," he said wearily.</p>

<p>"Good!" the sheriff exploded. "I
don't know whether I'd rather have
him show up or not. If this whole
business is nothing more than the
crazy imagination of some kid who
ought to get tanned and a star-cop
with milk behind his ears, I'm really
in the soup. I've sent out an alarm
and I've got the whole state jumping.
There's a full mechanized battalion
of state troops waiting in
there." He pointed toward the power
plant. "They've got artillery and
tanks all around the place."</p>

<p>Jordan jumped down out of the
ship. "Let's see what you've got set
up here. In the meantime, stop fretting.
I'd rather see you fired than
vaporized along with fifty million
other people."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right there," Berkhammer
conceded, "but I don't like
to have anyone make a fool out of
me."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At Ballarat, an old man, Eddie
Yudovich, was the watchman and
general caretaker of the electrical
generation plant. Actually, his job
was a completely unnecessary one,
since the plant ran itself. In its very
center, buried in a mine of graphite
were the tubes of hafnium, from
whose nuclear explosions flowed a
river of electricity without the need
of human thought or direction.</p>

<p>He had worked for the company
for a long time and when he became
crippled with arthritis, the directors
gave him the job so that he
might have security in his latter
years.</p>

<p>Yudovich, however, was a proud
old man, and he never once acknowledged
to himself or to anyone else
that his work was useless. He guarded
and checked the plant as though
it were the storehouse of the Terrestrial
Treasury. Every hour punctually,
he made his rounds through the
building.</p>

<p>At approximately seven thirty he
was making his usual circuit when
he came to the second level. What
he discovered justified all the years
of punctilious discharge of his duties.
He was startled to see a man kneeling
on the floor, just above where
the main power lines ran. He had
torn a hole in the composition floor,
and as Yudovich watched, he reached
in and pulled out the great cable.
Immediately the intruder glowed in
the semidarkness with an unearthly
blue shine and sparkles crackled off
of his face, hands and feet.</p>

<p>Yudovich stood rooted to the
floor. He knew very well that no man
could touch that cable and live. But
as he watched, the intruder handled
it with impunity, pulling a length
of wire out of his pocket and making
some sort of a connection.</p>

<p>It was too much for the old man.
Electricity was obviously being
stolen. He roared out at the top of
his voice, and stumped over to the
wall where he threw the alarm
switch. Immediately, a hundred arc
lights flashed on, lighting the level
brighter than the noon sun, and a
tremendously loud siren started wailing
its warning to the whole countryside.</p>

<p>The intruder jumped up as though
he had been stabbed. He dropped
the wires, and after a wild look
around him, he ran at full speed toward
the far exit.</p>

<p>"Hold on there," Yudovich shouted
and tried to give chase, but his
swollen, crooked knees almost collapsed
with the effort.</p>

<p>His eyes fell on a large wrench
lying on a worktable, and he snatched
it up and threw it with all his
strength. In his youth he had been
a ball player with some local fame
as a pitcher, and in his later life, he
was addicted to playing horseshoes.
His aim was, therefore, good, and
the wrench sailed through the air
striking the runner on the back of
the head. Sparks flew and there was
a loud metallic clang, the wrench
rebounding high in the air. The man
who was struck did not even turn
his head, but continued his panicky
flight and was gone in a second.</p>

<p>When he realized there was no
hope of effecting a capture, Yudovich
stumped over to see the amount
of the damage. A hole had been torn
in the floor, but the cable itself was
intact.</p>

<p>Something strange caught his attention.
Wherever the intruder had
put his foot down, there were many
radiating cracks in the composition
floor, just as though someone had
struck a sheet of ice with a sledge
hammer.</p>

<p>"I'll be danged," he said to himself.
"I'll be danged and double
danged."</p>

<p>He turned off the alarm and then
went downstairs to the teledepth
screen to notify the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from the
powerhouse, Jon Hall stood in the
darkness, listening to the voices of
his fellows. There were eighteen of
them, not seventeen, for a short
while before the one in the ice cave
had been captured, and they railed
at him with a bitter hopeless anger.</p>

<p>He looked toward the bright lights
of the powerhouse, considering
whether he should return. "It's too
late," said one of them. "The alarm
is already out." "Go into the town
and mix with the people," another
suggested. "If you stay within a
half mile of the hafnium pile, the
detection man will not be able to
pick up your radiation and maybe
you will have a second chance."</p>

<p>They all assented in that, and
Hall, weary of making his own decisions
turned toward the town. He
walked through a tree-lined residential
street, the houses with neatly
trimmed lawns, and each with a
copter parked on the roof. In almost
every house the teledepths were turned
on and he caught snatches of
bulletins about himself: "... Is
known to be in the Mojave area."
"... About six feet in height and
very similar to a human being. When
last seen, he was dressed in&mdash;"
"Governor Leibowitz has promised
speedy action and attorney general
Markle has stated&mdash;"</p>

<p>The main street of Ballarat was
brilliantly lighted. Many of the residents,
aroused by the alarm from the
powerhouse, were out, standing in
small groups in front of the stores
and talking excitedly to one another.</p>

<p>He hesitated, unwilling to walk
through the bright street, but uncertain
where to turn. Two men
talking loudly came around the corner
suddenly and he stepped back
into a store entrance to avoid them.
They stopped directly in front of
him. One of them, an overalled farm
hand from his looks, said, "He killed
a kid just a little while ago. My
brother-in-law heard it."</p>

<p>"Murderer," the other said viciously.</p>

<p>The farmer turned his head and
his glance fell on Hall. "Well, a
new face in town," he said after a
moment's inspection. "Say I bet
you're a reporter from one of the
papers, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Hall came out of the entrance and
tried to walk around the two men,
but the farmer caught him by the
sleeve.</p>

<p>"A reporter, huh? Well, I got
some news for you. That thing from
Grismet just killed a kid."</p>

<p>Hall could restrain himself no
longer.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," he said coldly.</p>

<p>The farmer looked him up and
down.</p>

<p>"What do you know about it," he
demanded. "My brother-in-law got
it from somebody in the state guard."</p>

<p>"It's still a lie."</p>

<p>"Just because it's not on the teledepth,
you say it's a lie," the farmer
said belligerently. "Not everything
is told on the teledepth, Mr. Wiseheimer.
They're keeping it a secret.
They don't want to scare the people."</p>

<p>Hall started to walk away, but the
farmer blocked his path.</p>

<p>"Who are you anyway? Where
do you live? I never saw you before,"
he said suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Aw, Randy," his companion said,
"don't go suspecting everybody."</p>

<p>"I don't like anyone to call me
a liar."</p>

<p>Hall stepped around the man in
his path, and turned down the street.
He was boiling inside with an almost
uncontrollable fury.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A few feet away, catastrophe suddenly
broke loose. A faulty section
of the sidewalk split without warning
under his feet and he went pitching
forward into the street. He
clutched desperately at the trunk of
a tall palm tree, but with a loud
snap, it broke, throwing him head
on into a parked road car. The entire
front end of the car collapsed like
an egg shell under his weight.</p>

<p>For a long moment, the entire
street was dead quiet. With difficulty,
Hall pulled himself to his feet. Pale,
astonished faces were staring at him
from all sides.</p>

<p>Suddenly the farmer started
screaming. "That's him. I knew it.
That's him." He was jumping up
and down with excitement.</p>

<p>Hall turned his back and walked
in the other direction. The people
in front of him faded away, leaving
a clear path.</p>

<p>He had gone a dozen steps when
a man with a huge double-barreled
shotgun popped out from a store
front just ahead. He aimed for the
middle of Hall's chest and fired both
barrels.</p>

<p>The blast and the shot struck Hall
squarely, burning a large hole in his
shirt front. He did not change his
pace, but continued step by step.</p>

<p>The man with the gun snatched
two shells out of his pocket and
frantically tried to reload. Hall
reached out and closed his hand
over the barrel of the gun and the
blue steel crumpled like wet paper.</p>

<p>From across the street, someone
was shooting at him with a rifle.
Several times a bullet smacked warmly
against his head or his back.</p>

<p>He continued walking slowly up
the street. At its far end several men
appeared dragging a small howitzer&mdash;probably
the only piece in the
local armory. They scurried around
it, trying to get it aimed and loaded.</p>

<p>"Fools. Stupid fools," Hall shouted
at them.</p>

<p>The men could not seem to get
the muzzle of the gun down, and
when he was a dozen paces from it
they took to their heels. He tore the
heavy cannon off of its carriage and
with one blow of his fist caved it in.
He left it lying in the street broken
and useless.</p>

<p>Almost as suddenly as it came,
his anger left him. He stopped and
looked back at the people cringing
in the doorways.</p>

<p>"You poor, cruel fools," Hall
said again.</p>

<p>He sat down in the middle of the
street on the twisted howitzer barrel
and buried his head in his hands.
There was nothing else for him to
do. He knew that in just a matter of
seconds, the ships with their permallium
nets and snares would be on
him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Since Jordan's ship was not large
enough to transport Jon Hall's great
weight back to Grismet, the terrestrial
government put at the agent's
disposal a much heavier vessel, one
room of which had been hastily lined
with permallium and outfitted as a
prison cell. A pilot by the name of
Wilkins went with the ship. He was
a battered old veteran, given to
cigar smoking, clandestine drinking
and card playing.</p>

<p>The vessel took off, rose straight
through the atmosphere for about
forty miles, and then hung, idly circling
Earth, awaiting clearance before
launching into the pulse drive.
A full course between Earth and
Grismet had to be plotted and cleared
by the technicians at the dispatch
center because the mass of the vessel
increased so greatly with its pulsating
speed that if any two ships passed
within a hundred thousand miles of
each other, they would at least be
torn from their course, and might
even be totally destroyed.</p>

<p>Wilkins had proposed a pinochle
game, and he and Jordan sat playing
in the control room.</p>

<p>The pilot had been winning and
he was elated. "Seventy-six dollars
so far," he announced after some
arithmetic. "The easiest day's pay
I made this month."</p>

<p>Jordan shuffled the cards and
dealt them out, three at a time. He
was troubled by his own thoughts,
and so preoccupied that he scarcely
followed the game.</p>

<p>"Spades, again," the pilot commented
gleefully. "Well, ain't that
too bad for you." He gave his cigar
a few chomps and played a card.</p>

<p>Jordan had been looking out of
the window. The ship had tilted and
he could see without rising the rim
of Earth forming a beautiful geometric
arc, hazy and blue in its shimmering
atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Come on, play," the pilot said,
impatiently. "I just led an ace."</p>

<p>Jordan put down his cards. "I
guess I better quit," he said.</p>

<p>"What the devil!" the pilot said
angrily. "You can't quit like that in
the middle of a deal. I got a flush
and aces."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Jordan said, "but I'm
going to lie down in my cabin until
we are given clearance."</p>

<p>He opened the door of the little
room and went into the hall. He
walked down past his own cabin and
stopped in front of another door, a
new one that was sheathed in permallium.
He hesitated a few moments;
then he snapped open the
outside latch and walked in, letting
the door swing closed behind him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Hall lay unmoving in the middle
of the floor, his legs and arms fastened
in greaves of permallium.</p>

<p>Jordan was embarrassed. He did
not look directly at the robot.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you want
to talk to me or not," he started.
"If you don't want to, that's all
right. But, I've followed you since
you landed on Earth, and I don't
understand why you did what you
did. You don't have to tell me, but
I wish you would. It would make
me feel better."</p>

<p>The robot shrugged&mdash;a very human
gesture, Jordan noted.</p>

<p>"G-go ahead and ask me," he
said. "It d-doesn't make any difference
now."</p>

<p>Jordan sat down on the floor.
"The boy was the one who gave you
away. If not for him, no one would
have ever known what planet you
were on. Why did you let the kid
get away?"</p>

<p>The robot looked straight at the
agent. "Would you kill a child?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," Jordan said
a little bit annoyed, "but I'm not
a robot either." He waited for a
further explanation, but when he
saw none was coming, he said: "I
don't know what you were trying
to do in that powerhouse at Ballarat,
but, whatever it was, that old man
couldn't have stopped you. What
happened?"</p>

<p>"I l-lost my head," the robot said
quietly. "The alarm and the lights
rattled me, and I got into a p-panic."</p>

<p>"I see," said Jordan, frustrated,
not really seeing at all. He sat back
and thought for a moment. "Let me
put it this way. Why do you stutter?"</p>

<p>Hall smiled a wry smile. "Th-that
used to be a m-military secret," he
said. "It's our one weakness&mdash;the
one Achilles heel in a m-machine
that was meant to be invulnerable."</p>

<p>He struggled to a sitting position.
"You see, we were m-made as s-soldiers
and had to have a certain loyalty
to the country that m-made us.
Only living things are loyal&mdash;machines
are not. We had to think like
human beings."</p>

<p>Jordan's brows contracted as he
tried to understand the robot.</p>

<p>"You mean you have a transplanted
human brain?" he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"In a way," Hall said. "Our
b-brains are permallium strips on
which the mind of some human
donor was m-magnetically imprinted.
My mind was copied f-from a man
who stuttered and who got panicky
when the going got rough, and who
couldn't kill a child no matter what
was at s-stake."</p>

<p>Jordan felt physically ill. Hall was
human and he was immortal. And
according to galactic decree, he, like
his fellows, was to be manacled in
permallium and fixed in a great block
of cement, and that block was to be
dropped into the deep silent depths
of the Grismet ocean, to be slowly
covered by the blue sediment that
gradually filters down through the
miles of ocean water to stay immobile
and blind for countless millions
of years.</p>

<p>Jordan arose to his feet. He could
think of nothing further to say.</p>

<p>He stopped, however, with the
door half open, and asked: "One
more question&mdash;what did you want
with the electrical generator plants
on Earth?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="700" height="427" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Slowly and without emotion Hall
told him, and when he understood,
he became even sicker.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He went across to his cabin and
stood for a while looking out the
window. Then he lit a cigarette and
lay down on his bunk thinking.
After a time, he put out the cigarette
and walked into the hall where he
paced up and down.</p>

<p>As he passed the cell door for
about the tenth time, he suddenly
swung around and lifted the latch
and entered. He went over to the
robot, and with a key that he took
from his pocket, he unlocked the
greaves and chains.</p>

<p>"There's no point in keeping you
bound up like this," he said. "I
don't think you're very dangerous."
He put the key back in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that this
ship runs on an atomic pile," he
said in a conversational tone of
voice. "The cables are just under the
floor in the control room and they
can be reached through a little trap
door."</p>

<p>Jordan looked directly into Hall's
face. The robot was listening with
great intentness.</p>

<p>"Well," the agent said, "we'll
probably be leaving Earth's atmosphere
in about fifteen minutes. I
think I'll go play pinochle with the
pilot."</p>

<p>He carefully left the door of the
cell unlatched as he left. He walked
to the control room and found Wilkins,
a dry cigar butt clenched between
his teeth, absorbed in a magazine.</p>

<p>"Let's have another game," Jordan
said. "I want some of that seventy-six
dollars back."</p>

<p>Wilkins shook his head. "I'm in
the middle of a good story here.
Real sexy. I'll play you after we take
off."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," Jordan said
sharply. "Let's play right now."</p>

<p>Wilkins kept reading. "We got an
eighteen-hour flight in front of us.
You have lots of time."</p>

<p>The agent snatched the magazine
out of his hands. "We're going to
play right now in my cabin," he
said.</p>

<p>"You quit when I have aces and a
flush, and now you come back and
want to play again. That's not sportsmanlike,"
Wilkins complained, but
he allowed himself to be led back
to Jordan's cabin. "I never saw anybody
so upset about losing a miserable
seventy-six bucks," was his final
comment.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The robot lay perfectly still until
he heard the door to Jordan's cabin
slam shut, and then he arose as
quietly as he could and stole out into
the hall. The steel of the hall floor
groaned, but bore his weight, and
carefully, trembling with excitement
inside of his ponderous metallic
body, he made his way to the control
room. He knelt and lifted the little
trap door and found the naked
power cable, pulsating with electrical
current.</p>

<p>In a locker under the panel board
he found a length of copper wire.
It was all he needed for the necessary
connection.</p>

<p>Since his capture, his fellows on
Grismet had been silent with despair,
but as he knelt to close the circuit,
their minds flooded in on him and
he realized with a tremendous horror
that there were now nineteen,
that all except he had been bound
and fixed in their eternal cement
prisons.</p>

<p>"We are going to have our
chance," he told them. "We won't
have much time, but we will have
our chance."</p>

<p>He closed the circuit and a tremendous
tide of electric power flowed
into his head. Inside that two-inch
shell of permallium was a small
strip of metal tape on whose electrons
and atoms were written the
borrowed mind of a man. Connected
to the tape was a minute instrument
for receiving and sending electromagnetic
impulses&mdash;the chain by
which the mind of one robot was
tied to that of another.</p>

<p>The current surged in and the
tiny impulses swelled in strength
and poured out through the hull of
the ship in a great cone that penetrated
Earth's atmosphere in a quadrant
that extended from Baffin land
to Omaha, and from Hawaii to
Labrador. The waves swept through
skin and bone and entered the sluggish
gelatinous brain of sentient
beings, setting up in those organs
the same thoughts and pictures that
played among the electrons of the
permallium strip that constituted Jon
Hall's mind.</p>

<p>All nineteen clamored to be heard,
for Hall to relay their voices to
Earth, but he held them off and first
he told his story.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Casseiopeian delegate to the
Galactic Senate was at the moment
finishing his breakfast. He was small
and furry, not unlike a very large
squirrel, and he sat perched on a
high chair eating salted roast almonds
of which he was very fond.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice started talking
inside of his head, just as it did at
that very second inside the heads of
thirteen billion other inhabitants of
the northwest corner of Earth. The
Casseiopeian delegate was so startled
that he dropped the dish of almonds,
his mouth popping open, his
tiny red tongue inside flickering
nervously. He listened spellbound.</p>

<p>The voice told him of the war on
Grismet and of the permallium constructed
robots, and of the cement
blocks. This, however, he already
knew, because he had been one of
the delegates to the Peace Conference
who had decided to dispose of
the robots. The voice, however, also
told him things he did not know,
such as the inability of the robots
to commit any crime that any other
sane human being would not commit,
of their very simple desire to be
allowed to live in peace, and most
of all of their utter horror for the
fate a civilized galaxy had decreed
for them.</p>

<p>When the voice stopped, the Casseiopeian
delegate was a greatly
shaken little being.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Back on the ship, Hall opened
the circuit to the nineteen, and they
spoke in words, in memory pictures
and in sensations.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A copter cab driver was hurrying
with his fare from Manhattan to
Oyster Bay. Suddenly, in his mind,
he became a permallium robot. He
was bound with cables of the heavy
metal, and was suspended upside
down in a huge cement block. The
stone pressed firmly on his eyes, his
ears, and his chest. He was completely
immobile, and worst of all, he
knew that above his head for six
miles lay the great Grismet Ocean,
with the blue mud slowly settling
down encasing the cement in a stony
stratum that would last till the planet
broke apart.</p>

<p>The cab driver gasped: "What the
hell." His throat was so dry he could
scarcely talk. He turned around to
his fare, and the passenger, a young
man, was pale and trembling.</p>

<p>"You seeing things, too?" the
driver asked.</p>

<p>"I sure am," the fare said unsteadily.
"What a thing to do."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For fifteen minutes, over the
northwest quadrant of Earth, the
words and the pictures went out,
and thirteen billion people knew
suddenly what lay in the hearts and
minds of nineteen robots.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A housewife in San Rafael was at
the moment in a butcher shop buying
meat for her family. As the
thoughts and images started pouring
into her mind, she remained stock-still,
her package of meat forgotten
on the counter. The butcher, wiping
his bloodied hands on his apron
froze in that position, an expression
of horror and incredulity on his
face.</p>

<p>When the thoughts stopped coming
in, the butcher was the first to
come out of the trancelike state.</p>

<p>"Boy," he said, "that's sure some
way of sending messages. Sure beats
the teledepths."</p>

<p>The housewife snatched her meat
off the counter. "Is that all you
think of," she demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"That's a terrible thing that those
barbarians on Grismet are doing to
those ... those people. Why didn't
they tell us that they were human."
She stalked out of the shop, not
certain what she would do, but determined
to do something.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the ship Hall reluctantly broke
off the connection and replaced the
trap door. Then he went back to his
cell and locked himself in. He had
accomplished his mission; its results
now lay in the opinions of men.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jordan left the ship immediately
on landing, and took a copter over
to the agency building. His conversation
with his superior was something
he wanted to get over with as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>The young woman at the secretary's
desk looked at him coldly and
led him directly into the inner office.
The chief was standing up in front
of the map of the galaxy, his hands
in his pockets, his eyes an icy blue.</p>

<p>"I've been hearing about you,"
he said without a greeting.</p>

<p>Jordan sat down. He was tense
and jumpy but tried not to show it.
"I suppose you have," he said, adding,
after a moment, "Sir."</p>

<p>"How did that robot manage to
break out of his cell and get to the
power source on the ship in the first
place?"</p>

<p>"He didn't break out," Jordan
said slowly. "I let him out."</p>

<p>"I see," the chief said, nodding.
"You let him out. I see. No doubt
you had your reasons."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did. Look&mdash;" Jordan
wanted to explain, but he could not
find the words. It would have been
different if the robots' messages had
reached Grismet; he would not have
had to justify himself then. But they
had not, and he could not find a
way to tell this cold old man of what
he had learned about the robots and
their unity with men. "I did it because
it was the only decent thing
to do."</p>

<p>"I see," the chief said. "You did
it because you have a heart." He
leaned suddenly forward, both hands
on his desk. "It's good for a man to
have a heart and be compassionate.
He's not worth anything if he isn't.
But"&mdash;and he shook his finger at
Jordan as he spoke&mdash;"that man is
going to be compassionate at his own
expense, not at the expense of the
agency. Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do," Jordan answered,
"but you have me wrong if you think
I'm here to make excuses or to
apologize. Now, if you will get on
with my firing, sir, I'll go home and
have my supper."</p>

<p>The chief looked at him for a
long minute. "Don't you care about
your position in the agency?" he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Sure I do," Jordan said almost
roughly. "It's the work I wanted to
do all my life. But, as you said, what
I did, I did at my own expense.
Look, sir, I don't like this any better
than you do. Why don't you fire me
and let me go home? Your prisoner's
safely locked up in the ship."</p>

<p>For answer the chief tossed him a
stellogram. Jordan glanced at the
first few words and saw that it was
from Galactic Headquarters on
Earth. He put it back on the desk
without reading it through.</p>

<p>"I know that I must have kicked
up a fuss. You don't have to spell
it out for me."</p>

<p>"Read it," the chief said impatiently.</p>

<p>Jordan took back the stellogram
and examined it. It read.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To: Captain Lawrence Macrae
Detection Agency, Grismet.</p>

<p>From: Prantal Aminopterin
Delegate from Casseiopeia
Chairman, Grismet Peace
Committee of the Galactic
Senate.</p>

<p>Message: You are hereby notified
that the committee by a vote of
17-0 has decided to rescind its
order of January 18, 2214, directing
the disposal of the permallium
robots of Grismet. Instead,
the committee directs that
you remove from their confinement
all the robots and put them
in some safe place where they
will be afforded reasonable and
humane treatment.</p>

<p>The committee will arrive in Grismet
some time during the next
month to decide on permanent
disposition.</p></div>

<p>Jordan's heart swelled as he read
the gram. "It worked," he said.
"They have changed their minds. It
won't be so bad being discharged
now." He put the paper back on
the desk and arose to go.</p>

<p>The chief smiled and it was like
sunlight suddenly flooding over an
arctic glacier. "Discharged? Now
who's discharging you? I'd sooner
do without my right arm."</p>

<p>He reached in a desk drawer and
pulled out a bottle of old Earth
bourbon and two glasses. He carefully
poured out a shot into each glass,
and handed one to Jordan.</p>

<p>"I like a man with a heart, and
if you get away with it, why then
you get away with it. And that's just
what you've done."</p>

<p>He sat down and started sipping
his whisky. Jordan stood uncertainly
above him, his glass in his hand.</p>

<p>"Sit down, son," the old man said.
"Sit down and tell me about your
adventures on Earth."</p>

<p>Jordan sat down, put his feet on
the desk and took a sizable swallow
of his whisky.</p>

<p>"Well, Larry," he started, "I got
into Earth atmosphere about 2:40
o'clock&mdash;"</p>
